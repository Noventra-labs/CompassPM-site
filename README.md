# CompassPM by Noventra

**AI-native product management workspace — Cursor for PMs.**

CompassPM connects to the tools your team already uses — Jira, Notion, Confluence, and Slack — scans your workspace for mismatches, then proposes precise multi-file fixes with diff previews and full source citations.

## What It Does

- **Finds every gap** — detects contradictions and drift between your planning and delivery systems.
- **Fixes everything in one command** — generates unified diffs across PRDs, tickets, and roadmap items with a complete audit trail.
- **Keeps your stack in sync** — automatic bi-directional sync with conflict resolution and change tracking.

## AI Agents
